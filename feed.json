Except for the part where I use square brackets around &ldquo;er&rdquo;, I wasn&rsquo;t sure about how to properly format that as I usually try to avoid tangents [like this] in my writing.)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Humans are faulty by nature. Even the greatest minds on our planet today make errors. This is a well-known fact.</p>\n<p>The recent eruption of AI has caused me to gain an entirely new view on the human factor and the ethics of removing it.</p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I have thought that humans were irreplaceable creatures. I believed that there are some things that a machine should <em>never</em> do. Machines are (presently) not able to consider things in the same way a human is. They lack a sense of judgement. Even if a human tried to program a machine to judge one simple task, you end up in an endless loop of &ldquo;what-ifs.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a machine tasked with judging whether a person should be ticketed for speeding.</p>\n<p>One may start by defining a system that writes a ticket if the driver is 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. But then the question of what if the driver is in an emergency arises. We inevitably have to ask what constitutes an emergency. What if your wife is wounded badly and you rushed her in your car instead of calling an ambulance (this is a sadly frequent occurrence because ambulances are PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE in the U.S.A.)? Does it count as a traffic violation since you disregarded the proper avenues? Either way, there are likely some situations we&rsquo;d want to consider this further. Every situation we add adds an infinitely complex series of questions that <em>need</em> answers in order to achieve autonomy. A machine simply cannot be created to do this. It needs to be able to empathize with humans.</p>\n<p>Empathy is an important skill. Not all people are great at it, some people who lack the ability to empathize view that as a strength, and further view those who can empathize as being weak. Ultimately, I will argue that the ability to empathize with one another, and the world around us is what ultimately separates us from machines. However, due to the nature of empathy, it is almost impossible to quantitate. An individual simply cannot define their own sense of empathy, let alone try to measure or describe someone else&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>I once fell in the camp of viewing empathy as a weakness. However, as I have learned more about the world, I have began to understand how flawed that view is. Changing your mind is hard, and oftentimes we don&rsquo;t even realize we&rsquo;ve done it until we sit down to write a blog post that briefly discusses the topic at hand.</p>\n<p>After playing around with ChatGPT and the like, I began to change my mind once again. I&rsquo;ve felt as though I&rsquo;ve been very aware of the process and my change in mindset. It first started as, the thought of how great it will be to replace mundane and unethical jobs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>(Note from CÂ²: I realize this is going to be considered a hot-take by many, but work in retail for 2 days, especially as a woman, and realize that this is the unbridled truth)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that retail workers still exist to the extent that they do is unethical. The mere fact that customers and managers exist who are allowed to harass innocent employees to no end is quite frankly disgusting, and wholly unethical. The fact that we as a society generally don&rsquo;t see the need to take immediate action against (primarily) men harassing (especially in the case of young[er]) women (especially, but not limited to) verbally is horrifying.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting and abhorrent that some men objectify women and discuss parts of them with others, regardless of their gender. If you so much as dare to not reciprocate this behaviour, or engage in it, you&rsquo;re quickly shunned. I&rsquo;ve flat out been told on multiple occasions that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not cool&rdquo; to act in a manner that doesn&rsquo;t objectify women into mere sex trophies.</p>\n<p>This inevitably brings me to the desire to &ldquo;remove the human factor&rdquo; for all the wrong reasons. I had begun writing this intending to conclude that I want to &ldquo;remove the human factor&rdquo; for situations like driving, where thousands of people are needlessly <em>murdered</em> each year by negligence on behalf of themselves, others, and their governments.</p>\n<p>However, I now realize that I have some deep desire to escape from contact with the general public (I strongly believe) due to my experiences working in retail, and furthering that goal is something that &ldquo;removing the human factor&rdquo; will probably achieve. It seems my brain has once again played tricks on me to downplay my (admittedly relatively minor) traumas.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d normally try to write a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; conclusion here, but this post has evolved from an attempt to document my thoughts into a realization that I can&rsquo;t fully grasp the reasoning behind any of my thoughts, but now I&rsquo;m having an existential crisis and want to go to bed, so I will.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>(Note from CÂ²: I feel like this ending has made me come off as one of those psychopaths that think humans need to go extinct. I don&rsquo;t believe that and that belief couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth if it tried to be. I simply have the desire to hide away from society for a while.)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-CÂ²</p>\n",

Even if a human tried to program a machine to judge one simple task, you end up in an endless loop of \"what-ifs.\" Let's take a machine tasked with judging whether a person should be ticketed for speeding.\r\n\r\nOne may start by defining a system that writes a ticket if the driver is 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. But then the question of what if the driver is in an emergency arises. We inevitably have to ask what constitutes an emergency. What if your wife is wounded badly and you rushed her in your car instead of calling an ambulance (this is a sadly frequent occurrence because ambulances are PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE in the U.S.A.)? Does it count as a traffic violation since you disregarded the proper avenues? Either way, there are likely some situations we'd want to consider this further. Every situation we add adds an infinitely complex series of questions that *need* answers in order to achieve autonomy. A machine simply cannot be created to do this. It needs to be able to empathize with humans. \r\n\r\nEmpathy is an important skill. Not all people are great at it, some people who lack the ability to empathize view that as a strength, and further view those who can empathize as being weak. Ultimately, I will argue that the ability to empathize with one another, and the world around us is what ultimately separates us from machines. However, due to the nature of empathy, it is almost impossible to quantitate. An individual simply cannot define their own sense of empathy, let alone try to measure or describe someone else's.\r\n\r\nI once fell in the camp of viewing empathy as a weakness. However, as I have learned more about the world, I have began to understand how flawed that view is. Changing your mind is hard, and oftentimes we don't even realize we've done it until we sit down to write a blog post that briefly discusses the topic at hand.\r\n\r\nAfter playing around with ChatGPT and the like, I began to change my mind once again. I've felt as though I've been very aware of the process and my change in mindset. It first started as, the thought of how great it will be to replace mundane and unethical jobs. \r\n\t\r\n>*(Note from CÂ²: I realize this is going to be considered a hot-take by many, but work in retail for 2 days, especially as a woman, and realize that this is the unbridled truth)* \r\n\r\nThe fact that retail workers still exist to the extent that they do is unethical. The mere fact that customers and managers exist who are allowed to harass innocent employees to no end is quite frankly disgusting, and wholly unethical. The fact that we as a society generally don't see the need to take immediate action against (primarily) men harassing (especially in the case of young[er]) women (especially, but not limited to) verbally is horrifying.\r\n\r\nIt's disgusting and abhorrent that some men objectify women and discuss parts of them with others, regardless of their gender. If you so much as dare to not reciprocate this behaviour, or engage in it, you're quickly shunned. I've flat out been told on multiple occasions that it's \"not cool\" to act in a manner that doesn't objectify women into mere sex trophies.\r\n\r\nThis inevitably brings me to the desire to \"remove the human factor\" for all the wrong reasons. I had begun writing this intending to conclude that I want to \"remove the human factor\" for situations like driving, where thousands of people are needlessly *murdered* each year by negligence on behalf of themselves, others, and their governments.\r\n\r\nHowever, I now realize that I have some deep desire to escape from contact with the general public (I strongly believe) due to my experiences working in retail, and furthering that goal is something that \"removing the human factor\" will probably achieve. It seems my brain has once again played tricks on me to downplay my (admittedly relatively minor) traumas.\r\n\r\nI'd normally try to write a \"proper\" conclusion here, but this post has evolved from an attempt to document my thoughts into a realization that I can't fully grasp the reasoning behind any of my thoughts, but now I'm having an existential crisis and want to go to bed, so I will.\r\n\r\n> *(Note from CÂ²: I feel like this ending has made me come off as one of those psychopaths that think humans need to go extinct. I don't believe that and that belief couldn't be further from the truth if it tried to be. I simply have the desire to hide away from society for a while.)*\r\n\r\n-CÂ²\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>(Note from CÂ²: This post contains no AI generated content.)</em></p>\n<p>We live in a time of great technological progress. Conversational AI has finally left the niche and entered the view of the general public through ChatGPT and Bing.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, we&rsquo;re quickly reaching a point where deepfaking voices is becoming terrifyingly easy. I&rsquo;ve attempted creating deepfakes of myself and a few consenting friends and had decent results with as little as 5 seconds of sample audio.</p>\n<p>That leads us to the future of scamming. Where we&rsquo;re going, and what we can do to protect ourselves and those close to us.</p>\n<h1 id=\"scenario\">Scenario</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>The following story is just that, a story. It&rsquo;s not based on an actual event. Purely on a theory of our future that could be completely wrong. It is written from the perspective of the victim to assist you in learning what to look out for.</p>\n<p>This hypothetical scam is an evolution of the well documented <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2021/04/dont-open-your-door-grandparent-scams\">Grandparent Scam</a>.</p>\n<p>The key difference from traditional Grandparent Scams is that the scammer obtains a voice sample from someone close to the victim. Be it from a video uploaded to social media, or by a phone-call to the subject. The scammer then uses this sample to create a realistic voice model that is in turn used to impersonate the subject.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-parent\">The Parent.</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re woken up in the middle of the night by a series of text messages from an unfamiliar phone number. They&rsquo;re claiming to be your daughter, she&rsquo;s recently gone on a trip to <em>a far away land</em>. She says that she&rsquo;s been arrested and needs money to get out right away.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of scams similar to this before, so you ask, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you using your phone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She responds &ldquo;They took it away! I&rsquo;ll call you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Your phone starts ringing, and you answer, it sounds just like your daughter, maybe a little different, but she&rsquo;s panicked and using a different phone, so it&rsquo;s only to be expected. At this point, all skepticism has left your mind. You truly believe this is your daughter.</p>\n<p>After some back and forth discussion, she again asks for money, and you, <strong>without suspecting anything</strong>, send it over, and wish her best of luck.</p>\n<p><em>unbeknownst to you, at this point, your money is <strong>gone</strong>. you have almost no chance of getting it back</em>.</p>\n<p>It is at this time, that you hop on social media to see if you can find any clues as to what happened. You notice that she posted a picture while you were on the phone. She&rsquo;s on a beach with her friends.</p>\n<p>You attempt to call phone number back, but no one answers. With no luck on that front, you call your daughter&rsquo;s normal phone number. She picks up, wondering why you sound panicked, and why you&rsquo;re asking about her getting arrested. <strong>She has no clue what you&rsquo;re talking about.</strong> You explain what happened and you both ultimately conclude that it was a scam.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve lost money to a scam like this, it was a crime. Report it to your local law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that you aren&rsquo;t stupid or gullible for falling victim to a scam. Scammers prey on our emotions and exploit them to their fullest potential in order to manipulate us. That is why we must learn how to recognize scams.</p>\n<h1 id=\"protecting-ourselves\">Protecting Ourselves</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>There are many methods we can use to differentiate scammers from those close to us. It&rsquo;s important that you not only rely on methods mentioned here, but also do research on other types of scams and their defenses, the defenses listed here are not suitable for defending against all types of scams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"passwords\">Passwords.</h2>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mean a password for your accounts. I mean a password for your family. That way, if anyone ever runs into a scenario where you need to verify someone&rsquo;s identity, you can just ask for the password.</p>\n<p>Your password could be something as simple as details on a shared experience you had, or something more complex like a phrase. Something like &ldquo;praise-golf-asparagus&rdquo;. You can use this <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/\">tool from Bitwarden</a> to generate passphrases.</p>\n<p>No matter what you choose, it&rsquo;s important that you never discuss this password with anyone outside your family or post it online.

				"content_text": "*(Note from CÂ²: This post contains no AI generated content.)*\n\nWe live in a time of great technological progress. Conversational AI has finally left the niche and entered the view of the general public through ChatGPT and Bing. \n\nIn addition to this, we're quickly reaching a point where deepfaking voices is becoming terrifyingly easy. I've attempted creating deepfakes of myself and a few consenting friends and had decent results with as little as 5 seconds of sample audio.\n\nThat leads us to the future of scamming. Where we're going, and what we can do to protect ourselves and those close to us.\n\n# Scenario\n---\nThe following story is just that, a story. It's not based on an actual event. Purely on a theory of our future that could be completely wrong. It is written from the perspective of the victim to assist you in learning what to look out for.\n\nThis hypothetical scam is an evolution of the well documented [Grandparent Scam](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2021/04/dont-open-your-door-grandparent-scams).\n\nThe key difference from traditional Grandparent Scams is that the scammer obtains a voice sample from someone close to the victim. Be it from a video uploaded to social media, or by a phone-call to the subject. The scammer then uses this sample to create a realistic voice model that is in turn used to impersonate the subject.\n\n## The Parent.\nYou're woken up in the middle of the night by a series of text messages from an unfamiliar phone number. They're claiming to be your daughter, she's recently gone on a trip to *a far away land*. She says that she's been arrested and needs money to get out right away.\n\nYou've heard of scams similar to this before, so you ask, \"Why aren't you using your phone?\"\n\nShe responds \"They took it away! I'll call you.\"\n\nYour phone starts ringing, and you answer, it sounds just like your daughter, maybe a little different, but she's panicked and using a different phone, so it's only to be expected. At this point, all skepticism has left your mind. You truly believe this is your daughter.\n\nAfter some back and forth discussion, she again asks for money, and you, **without suspecting anything**, send it over, and wish her best of luck.\n\n*unbeknownst to you, at this point, your money is **gone**. you have almost no chance of getting it back*.\n\nIt is at this time, that you hop on social media to see if you can find any clues as to what happened. You notice that she posted a picture while you were on the phone. She's on a beach with her friends. \n\nYou attempt to call phone number back, but no one answers. With no luck on that front, you call your daughter's normal phone number. She picks up, wondering why you sound panicked, and why you're asking about her getting arrested. **She has no clue what you're talking about.** You explain what happened and you both ultimately conclude that it was a scam.\n\nIf you've lost money to a scam like this, it was a crime. Report it to your local law enforcement agency. \n\nIt's important to remember that you aren't stupid or gullible for falling victim to a scam. Scammers prey on our emotions and exploit them to their fullest potential in order to manipulate us. That is why we must learn how to recognize scams.\n\n# Protecting Ourselves\n---\nThere are many methods we can use to differentiate scammers from those close to us. It's important that you not only rely on methods mentioned here, but also do research on other types of scams and their defenses, the defenses listed here are not suitable for defending against all types of scams.\n\n## Passwords.\nI don't mean a password for your accounts. I mean a password for your family. That way, if anyone ever runs into a scenario where you need to verify someone's identity, you can just ask for the password.\n\nYour password could be something as simple as details on a shared experience you had, or something more complex like a phrase. Something like \"praise-golf-asparagus\". You can use this [tool from Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/) to generate passphrases.\n\nNo matter what you choose, it's important that you never discuss this password with anyone outside your family or post it online. If a scammer is able to get ahold of your password and exploit it, it is worse than not having one.\n\n## Callback.\nIf you get a call from a family member's phone number, tell them you need to call them back and hang up. Then, dial their phone number yourself. This ensures that you are speaking to the actual owner of the phone number and not a spoofed number.\n\nThis has the weakness of being vulnerable to [SIM swap](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2019/10/sim-swap-scams-how-protect-yourself) attacks though. So using additional methods is a good idea.\n\n## Video.\nWe're still quite a ways off being able to deepfake someone's face in real time. Use this to your advantage. If you're still unsure after validating your family password, make them join a video call. If they won't, don't trust them.\n\n## Ponder.\nAlways be wary of urgent requests. Scammers use urgency to place massive amounts of pressure on their victims. If someone claims they need money, or personal information right away, it's important to take a step back and ponder their request.\n",
